-- Allow newer versions of template-haskell to work with uuid-types
-- This workaround is needed for GHC 9.14+ where uuid-types hasn't yet declared support for template-haskell 2.24
-- Broad allow-newer for base due to GHC 9.14+ compatibility issues with servant ecosystem
-- In production, consider using constraints to pin to known-good versions
allow-newer: uuid-types:template-haskell, *:base, *:template-haskell
